title: Letter To My Younger Self

Just get in a room with yourself.\
Or maybe go on a walk.\
Alone.
<!--more-->

Close your eyes, breathe deep.\
Your mind will go crazy.\
Do so until it stops.

It’s all suddenly black.\
You have no thoughts, no pains, no worries.\
Your brain still works: you can smell, taste, touch, and feel.

Once you have removed thought,\
all of the remainings,\
all of what’s left will be truth.

But, most importantly,\
don’t do it because someone else does it.\
Don’t do it because someone else recommended it to you.

Do it because you have no other choice.
