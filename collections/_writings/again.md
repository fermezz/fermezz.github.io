I've been dreaming about this moment,\
in which we run into each other casually.\
We immediately say how much we've missed each other.\
Not with words, of course. We are not that vulgar.

We do so by slowly getting closer and closer together until we are one.\
I can taste your hand offering some comfort to my sadness.\
I can smell your hopelessness vanishing away,\
you won't need that anymore.

By holding each other mindlessly,\
we enter the world where time doesn't exist.\
Time is only a consequence of thought, remember?\
And we don't want to think.

We don't want to think,\
because being conscious of the time we've been apart\
is a feeling neither of us want to experience again,\
and because this one moment, and only this moment, we both know, is truth.
