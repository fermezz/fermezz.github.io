I've been dreaming about this moment, in which we run into each other casually.
We immediately say how much we've missed each other.
Not with words, of course, we are not that vulgar.
We do so by slowly getting closer and closer together until we are one.

I can feel your hand consoland my sadness
I can smell your desesperanza vanishing away.
And your hope, you don't need any of those anymore.

By holding each other mindlessly,
we enter the world where time doesn't exist.
Time is only a consequence of thought, we both know.
And we don't want to think.

We don't want to think
Because being conscious of the time we've been apart
Is a feeling neither of us wants to experience ever again
And because this one moment, we both know, is truth.

You start to vanish and the invitable realization comes into my mind again:
I have mind, I have time, I have pain.
I have lost you.
I was dreaming again.
