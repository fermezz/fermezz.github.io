We're walking down the park and you suddenly stop:

– Oh, shit.\
– What?\
– The grass! It's all wet.\
– So?\
– So!? *We* are gonna get wet.

I smile at you and playfully put you in my shoulders. You scream at me, laughing, to leave you alone. I do so, once we are past the flooded area. I do so slowly and once your feet are on the floor, we kiss.

Already in the sidewalk, a kid runs into us fullspeed with his bike while his father is chasing after him asking for him to hit the brakes. After the distraction, I look around and can only see cars, trees and the kid and his father.

How can it be that I'm always alone when I'm with you?
